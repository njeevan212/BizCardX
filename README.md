# BizCardX
   In this app user can upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR. You can view, modify or delete the extracted data in this app. This app would also allow users to save the extracted information into a MYSQL database along with the uploaded business card image as Blob. The database would be able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information.
